# Gene Expression Analysis of Selectively Vulnerable Neurons to Tauopathy in Alzheimer's Disease

This repository contains analyses that aim to identify gene expression signatures that characterise selectively vulnerable neurons in Alzheimer's Disease.
In this particular branch, a detailed R Markdown analysis of entorhinal cortex excitatory neurons in Braak stage 6, 2, and 0 patients are presented, the data being derived from [Leng et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00764-7).

In order to rerun the analysis, please download this Google Drive folder to first obtain the raw data:  
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xWx9dAYfPk6iYcvj3Qvo6ec0k4k-CvbM?usp=sharing  
The folder contains subdirectory `assets` which holds the raw data and the subdirectory `results` which contains compiled R Markdown HTML files. Rerunning the analysis produces these HTML files.

The Googld Drive folder should be renamed `gdrive` and placed in the top-level of this project.

For reproducibility, we provide several options for replicating the environment used in the original analysis:

### 1. Docker

This approach requires Docker installation and setup [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/).  
The simplest command is to run `run_all.R` non-interactively with the following:

```
docker-compose up all
```

If one wishes to use RStudio, first create a `.env` file with the port you would like to use, as so:

```
PORT=8787
```

Then open RStudio with:

```
docker-compose up rstudio
```

If the Docker container is being launched on a remote machine, an SSH tunnel like the one below will be needed:

```
ssh -N -L 8787:localhost:8787 user@ip-address
```

### 2. Singularity

This approach is similar to using Docker except with a Singularity wrapper to meet the security requirements common in high-performance computing (HPC).  
Similar to before, `run_all.R` is called non-interactively with:

```
sh ./singularity.sh all
```

To use RStudio, no `.env` file is needed, it is instead included in the command:

```
sh ./singularity.sh rstudio 8787
```

As before, an SSH tunnel is required if connecting remotely.
