*This is an in-depth analysis to characterize differential vulnerability to tauopathy.*

The background for this data is as follows:

This analysis was performed in R except where noted.
The source code and instructions for rerunning the analysis can be found at [github.com/eturkes/tau-vulnerability](https://github.com/eturkes/tau-vulnerability).

# Final Results

**Read just this section for the final results of the analysis and a summary of the methods.**

# ~~~~ Breakdown of Methods ~~~~ {-}

The following top-level sections break down the methods used to perform the analysis and only needs to be read if one is interested.
We start by setting some global variables and loading in any required packages.

```{r}
assets_dir <- file.path(getwd(), "..", "assets")
results_dir <- file.path(getwd(), "..", "results")
```

```{r}
library(conflicted)
library(devtools)
```

# Original Data

# References

This is the concluding section of the document.
Here we write relevant results to disk, output the `session_info`, and create a bibliography for works cited.

```{r}
session_info()
```
