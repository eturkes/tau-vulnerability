	abstract = {Biological data analysis often deals with lists of genes arising from various studies. The g:Proﬁler toolset is widely used for ﬁnding biological categories enriched in gene lists, conversions between gene identiﬁers and mappings to their orthologs. The mission of g:Proﬁler is to provide a reliable service based on up-to-date high quality data in a convenient manner across many evidence types, identiﬁer spaces and organisms. g:Proﬁler relies on Ensembl as a primary data source and follows their quarterly release cycle while updating the other data sources simultaneously. The current update provides a better user experience due to a modern responsive web interface, standardised API and libraries. The results are delivered through an interactive and conﬁgurable web design. Results can be downloaded as publication ready visualisations or delimited text ﬁles. In the current update we have extended the support to 467 species and strains, including vertebrates, plants, fungi, insects and parasites. By supporting user uploaded custom GMT ﬁles, g:Proﬁler is now capable of analysing data from any organism. All past releases are maintained for reproducibility and transparency. The 2019 update introduces an extensive technical rewrite making the services faster and more ﬂexible. g:Proﬁler is freely available at https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gproﬁler.},

	abstract = {Cells, the basic units of biological structure and function, vary broadly in type and state. Singlecell genomics can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly proﬁling thousands of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell’s RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts’ cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identiﬁed 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine transcriptional proﬁling at singlecell resolution.},

	abstract = {Normalization of single-cell RNA sequencing data is necessary to eliminate cell-specific biases prior to downstream analyses. However, this is not straightforward for noisy single-cell data where many counts are zero. We present a novel approach where expression values are summed across pools of cells, and the summed values are used for normalization. Pool-based size factors are then deconvolved to yield cell-based factors. Our deconvolution approach outperforms existing methods for accurate normalization of cell-specific biases in simulated data. Similar behavior is observed in real data, where deconvolution improves the relevance of results of downstream analyses.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is an essential method for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset but for large-scale scRNA-seq datasets, the computation consumes a long time and large memory space. In this work, we review the existing fast and memory-eﬃcient PCA algorithms and implementations and evaluate their practical application to large-scale scRNA-seq dataset. Our benchmark showed that some PCA algorithms based on Krylov subspace and randomized singular value decomposition are fast, memory-eﬃcient, and accurate than the other algorithms. Considering the diﬀerence of computational environment of users and developers, we also developed the guideline to select the appropriate PCA implementations.},
