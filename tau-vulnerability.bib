The transentorhinal region mediates between the adjoining temporal isocortex laterally and the entorhinal region medially. The entorhinal cortex consists of a molecular layer, followed by an external principal stratum, a cell-sparse lamina dissecans, an internal principal stratum and - within the underlying white matter - a profound cellular layer. The principal strata can each be divided into three layers Pre a,/3, 7, and Pri a,/3, y. Data obtained from experimental investigations in monkeys reveal that the entorhinal territory serves as a relay station for information from both isocortical association areas and centers of the limbic system. After processing within the entorhinal cortex, this information is transferred to the hippocampal formation via the perforant path. Pathological changes within the entorhinal territory impair this continuous data transfer and contribute to a decline of cognitive functions. Entorhinal involvement associated with impaired cognitive functions is described in cases of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia with argyrophilic grains and Huntington's disease.},

Neurofibrillary changes occurred in the form of neuritic plaques, neurofibritlary tangles and neuropil threads. The distribution of neuritic plaques varied widely not only within architectonic units but also from one individual to another. Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, in contrast, exhibited a characteristic distribution pattern permitting the differentiation of six stages. The first two stages were characterized by an either mild or severe alteration of the transentorhinal layer Pre-c\textasciitilde{} (transentorhinal stages I-II). The two forms of limbic stages (stages III-IV) were marked by a conspicuous affection of layer Pre-(x in both transentorhinal region and proper entorhinal cortex. In addition, there was mild involvement of the first Ammon's horn sector. The hallmark of the two isocortical stages (stages V-VI) was the destruction of virtually all isocortical association areas. The investigation showed that recognition of the six stages required qualitative evaluation of only a few key preparations.},

We report the presence of abnormal tau changes within solitary pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of the neocortex. These pyramidal cells showed pathology in different cell compartments (dendritic, somatic, axonal) that appeared to occur sequentially: Tau pathology was seen in distal segments of the basal dendrites, then in proximal dendrites, the soma, and, finally, in the axon of affected neurons. These findings are remarkable in that they point to the existence of neurofibrillary changes in regions routinely associated with later NFT stages. In addition, they lend support to the idea that it may be the axons of corticocortical top-down neurons in neocortical fields involved in AD that carry and spread abnormal tau seeds in a focused manner (transsynaptically) into the distal dendritic segments of nerve cells following directly in the neuronal chain, thereby sustaining further tau-seeded templating.},

  abstract = {Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Depositions of amyloid {$\beta$} peptide (A{$\beta$}) and tau protein are among the major pathological hallmarks of AD. A{$\beta$} and tau burden follows predictable spatial patterns during the progression of AD. Nevertheless, it remains obscure why certain brain regions are more vulnerable than others; to investigate this and dysregulated pathways during AD progression, a mass spectrometry-based proteomics study was performed.
Methods: In total 103 tissue samples from regions early (entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices - medial temporal lobe (MTL)) and late affected (temporal and frontal cortices - neocortex) by tau pathology were subjected to label-free quantitative proteomics analysis.
Results: Considering dysregulated proteins during AD progression, the majority (625 out of 737 proteins) was region specific, while some proteins were shared between regions (101 proteins altered in two areas and 11 proteins altered in three areas). Analogously, many dysregulated pathways during disease progression were exclusive to certain regions, but a few pathways altered in two or more areas. Changes in protein expression indicate that synapse loss occurred in all analyzed regions, while translation dysregulation was preponderant in entorhinal, parahippocampal and frontal cortices. Oxidative phosphorylation impairment was prominent in MTL. Differential proteomic analysis of brain areas in health state (controls) showed higher metabolism and increased expression of AD-related proteins in the MTL compared to the neocortex. In addition, several proteins that differentiate brain regions in control tissue were dysregulated in AD.
Conclusions: This work provides the comparison of proteomic changes in brain regions affected by tau pathology at different stages of AD. Although we identified commonly regulated proteins and pathways during disease advancement, we found that the dysregulated processes are predominantly region specific. In addition, a distinct proteomic signature was found between MTL and neocortex in healthy subjects that might be related to AD},

Damage to the brain appears to spread and worsens with time, taking over more regions and activating multiple stressors that can converge to promote vulnerability of certain cell types. At the same time, other cell types and brain regions remain intact in the face of this onslaught of neuropathology. Although neuropathologic descriptions of AD have been extensively expanded and mapped over the last several decades, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying how certain regions and cell populations are specifically vulnerable or resistant has lagged behind. In this review, we detail what is known about the selectivity of local initiation of AD pathology in the hippocampus, its proposed spread via synaptic connections, and the diversity of clinical phenotypes and brain atrophy patterns that may arise from different fibrillar strains of pathologic proteins or genetic predispositions. We summarize accumulated and emerging knowledge of the cellular and molecular basis for neuroanatomic selectivity, consider potential disease-relevant differences between vulnerable and resistant neuronal cell types and isolate molecular markers to identify them.},

This LC-NE system plays a critical role in a variety of brain functions, including attention, arousal, emotion, cognition, and the sleep-wake cycle. The LC is one of the brain regions vulnerable to the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which is associated with ``primary age-related tauopathy (PART)'' that describes the pathology commonly observed in the brains of aged individuals. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the LC is one of the first places to develop NFTs, which may act as a seed for subsequent spreading of the pathology throughout the brain upon amyloid-b (Ab) accumulation. As AD progresses, significant neuron loss occurs in the LC. Moreover, LC neurodegeneration is not only a consequence of AD, but also drives clinical and pathological manifestations of AD, such as microglial dysregulation, sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and neurovascular dysfunction. Therefore, prevention of NFT pathology and neuron loss in the LC-NE system is critical for suppressing the progression of AD. We propose that targeting aging itself may be a proactive intervention against age-associated changes in the LC. Such an approach could open the way for novel interventions against age-associated neurodegenerative disorders, in particular, AD.},

A growing body of literature suggests that conformational characteristics of tau filaments, along with regional vulnerability to tau pathology, account for the distinct histopathological morphologies, biochemical composition, and affected cell types seen across these disorders. In this review, we describe and discuss recent evidence from human postmortem and clinical biomarker studies addressing the differential vulnerability of brain areas to tau pathology, its cell-to-cell transmission, and characteristics of the different strains that tau aggregates can adopt. Cellular biosensor assays are increasingly used in human tissue to detect the earliest forms of tau pathology, before overt histopathological lesions (i.e., neurofibrillary tangles) are apparent. Animal models with localized tau expression are used to uncover the mechanisms that influence spreading of tau aggregates. Further, studies of human postmortem-derived tau filaments from different tauopathies injected in rodents have led to striking findings that recapitulate neuropathology-based staging of tau. Furthermore, the recent advent of tau positron emission tomography and novel fluid-based biomarkers render it possible to study the temporal progression of tau pathology in vivo. Ultimately, evidence from these approaches must be integrated to better understand the onset and progression of tau pathology across tauopathies. This will lead to improved methods for the detection and monitoring of disease progression and, hopefully, to the development and refinement of tau-based therapeutics.},
